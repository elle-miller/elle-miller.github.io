Hi there! I'm Elle, currently a **1st year PhD student** at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/) supervised by [Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/slmc) and [Dr. Stefano V. Albrecht Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I'm researching reinforcement learning for contact-rich robotic manipulation, with an emphasis on multimodal and tactile sensing. I hope to apply my research to scenarios ranging from dexterous manipulation to physical assistance for people with motor impairments.

I had the incredible opportunity to work at **NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory** and the **DLR Institute for Mechatronics and Robotics** after university. At NASA I researched semantic perception for robotic autonomy in hazardous environments, while at DLR I worked on an inspiring assistive robotics system called [EDAN](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-11670). Along the way I also helped create a mobile humanoid robot called [EVA](https://youtu.be/nMkcBbofDY0)! 

I graduated with First Class Honours in a BEng (Mechatronic (Space)) & BSc (Advanced Physics) from the **University of Sydney** in 2023. As an undergraduate, I undertook several internships in parallel with my studies, working with the **Max Planck Institute of Astronomy**, **University of Cambridge**, **Cochlear**, **Australian National University**, and **Saber Astronautics**.

I am very excited by the intersection of robotics and machine learning, and how these fields can advance and benefit humanity in a wide range of settings from space exploration to healthcare. On a personal note, I enjoy playing and making music, film photography, cinema, and seeing the world. Feel free to get in contact!
