Hi there! Iâ€™m Elle, a **2nd year PhD student** at the University of Edinburgh (UoE).

Iâ€™m researching reinforcement learning for contact-rich robotic manipulation, with an emphasis on tactile sensing. I'm planning on applying my research widely, from dexterous manipulation to physical assistance for people with motor impairments.

I am fortunate to have an awesome PhD supervision team: [Prof. Sethu Vijayakumar](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/slmc) (UoE), [Associate Prof. Oisin Mac Aodha](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/omacaod/) (UoE), [Dr. David Abel](https://david-abel.github.io/) (UoE, DeepMind), and [Associate Prof. Rika Antonova](https://contactrika.github.io/) (University of Cambridge).

Prior to my doctorate I worked for **NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)** and the **DLR Institute for Mechatronics and Robotics**. At NASA I researched semantic perception for robotic autonomy in hazardous environments, while at DLR I worked improving user agency in grasping on the  inspiring assistive robotics system [EDAN](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-11670). Along the way I also helped create a mobile humanoid robot called [EVA](https://youtu.be/nMkcBbofDY0).

I graduated with First Class Honours in a BEng (Mechatronic (Space)) & BSc (Advanced Physics) from the **University of Sydney** in 2023. As an undergraduate, I undertook several internships in parallel with my studies, working with the **Max Planck Institute of Astronomy**, **University of Cambridge**, **Cochlear**, **Australian National University**, and **Saber Astronautics**.

<!-- I would like to see a world where robots very excited by the intersection of robotics and machine learning, and how these fields can advance and benefit humanity in a wide range of settings from space exploration to healthcare.  -->

On a personal note, I enjoy playing and making music, film photography, lindy hop, cinema, and living in different cities. Feel free to get in touch ðŸ’Œ
